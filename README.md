## Design

## Colour Scheme

As the hero image on the page is of the United States flag which is red white and blue, and both the republic and democratic parties are red and blue. I thought it would be best to keep a consistent colour scheme throughout each page in the interest of UX.

In my css file, you will see I have used the below colours:

   * #f5f5f5 & #000000  
   * red
   * blue



### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the page title the site features the font [XXX](XXX)

![XXX Example](XXX)

*For the body of the page the site uses the google font [XXX](XXX)

### Imagery

As the website is called US Election 2024, I wanted to go for a patriotic hero image for the Home page, which is why I've gone for the classic american flag.

I also wanted to keep the reasoning for the site obvious, in the interest of UX, which is why on the home page I have also used a Trump Vs. Kamala side by side.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet & also desktop computers, using the Balsamiq app.

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page giving a simplistic key breakdown of policies for both candidates. A page deep diving into Donald Trump with 5 of his most criticised stance on policies, what he has said about them specifically, the fact check for them and the reference link to that fact check. Next is a page deep diving into Kamala Harris, looking at the exact same things as the Donald Trump page & lastly a poll page where people can vote for who is the best candidate after reading the site.

All pages are responsive from XXpx to XXpx and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab
   
  ![favicon](XXX)

* The nav bar at the top of the page, so as to show what page the user is on & also ways to get back to different pages.

### The Home Page

The home page of Trump Vs Kamala 2024 displays a hero banner image of an American flag at the top of the page. A navigation bar directly below it. Then there is a picture of Kamala Harris on the left and Donald Trump on the right. With a comparison table in the middle of them highlighting the main key point where each stand. In combat sports this is known as Tale Of The Tape.

As I want to keep the site informative but minimalistic in the interest of UX, the last part of the home page will be the footer. On the footer it will have links to social media & an audio controller to play some entertaining songs such as the theme music to Rocky.

### The Donald Trump Page

The Donald Trump page will feather the same height and width banner but with the TRUMP / VANCE logo. The background color will be white and the font will be Blue for Trump and Red for Vance, it will also contain the slogan Make America Great Again, with a solid blue border and a break at the bottom which will include the text 2024 in red. This is for consistency to what the user would see everywhere else.

Below the banner will be the same nav bar as the home page for cosistency & UX.

Below the nav bar will have a picture of Donald Trump on the left and then text on the right detailing the top 5 criticisms of him. These will also include a fact check and the reference to that fact check.

For consistency, at the bottom of the page will be the footer. This will include social links to follow Donald Trump and a link to donate to Donald Trumps campaign. 

### The Kamala Harris Page

The structure of this page will follow the Donald Trump page with a banner at the top with the Harris / Walz logo. Background color will be white, Harris text will be Blue, Walz text will be red and will have a solid blue border around it.

Below the banner will be the nav bar for UX. Showing what page the user is on.

Below the banner will be a picture of Kamala Harris on the left and her top 5 most criticisms and again, will include, fact checks and reference for those fact checks.

lastly at the bottom of the page will include social links to Kamala Harris and a link to donate to Kamala Harris campaign.
