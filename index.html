                    <li><strong> Supports Roe V. Wade:</strong> Harris is pro choice and believes that abortion should
                        be available to all
                        women. This seemed to be very popular amongst voters, as shown in this <a

                            Gabbard</a> interview. Reports say Harris being tough on crime reflects her commitment to
                        ensuring public
                        safety while advocating for fair and just legal practices.</li>

                        Harris would be the
                        first female president of colour in the U.S history.
